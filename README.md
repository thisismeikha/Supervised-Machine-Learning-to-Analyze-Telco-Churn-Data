# Supervised-Machine-Learning-to-Analyze-Telco-Churn-Data

This repository is a continuation of my previous repository that explore telco churn data analysis with EDA (https://github.com/thisismeikha/EDA-for-Telco-Churn-Data). To estimate factors behind churn decision, I developed four models, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. To find the best model, I employed metrics specified for unbalanced data.

Based on the evaluation metrics, Logistic Regression has the highest metrics among all other models. Thus we can use the model to analyze the data.

Here is the detail variables in the churn data

I will create a new variable, namely total_service, to catch the idea, whether adding more services could trigger churn
