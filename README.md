# Supervised-Machine-Learning-to-Analyze-Telco-Churn-Data

This repository is a continuation of my previous repository that explore telco churn data analysis with EDA (https://github.com/thisismeikha/EDA-for-Telco-Churn-Data). 

To estimate factors behind churn decision, I developed four models, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. My goal is to find the best model.

Based on the evaluation metrics specified for unbalance data, I found that Logistic Regression is the best model among all other models because the model has the highest evaluation metrics.

Here is the detail variables in the churn data. The data itself can be downloaded here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
Target: 
Churn â€” Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No)

Feature:
PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Customer account information, Tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, customerID, Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

New Variable:
I will create a new variable, namely total_service, to catch the idea, whether adding more services could trigger churn
